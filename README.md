## Instructions for running
- Running `make` or `make all` will compile both the versions of the program, i.e `ltcg_debug` meant for debugging and `ltcg_optimized` compiled using O2 flag.
- Running `make clean` will cleanup the executables.
- The file `main.cpp` contains the source of the program and `ltcg_debug` and `ltcg_optimized` are the executables.
